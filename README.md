Problem: Assume you are a TLP participant on an Agile team with a number of developers and testers. You have been asked by your team to work on very important functionality on Vanguard’s website. The business owner assigned to your project has provided the following specifications:

 Your business owner says:
 The goal of this tool is to show a client whether they are ready to retire. There are two simple considerations to keep in mind. 
 First, the client can only retire after age 59 ½. Otherwise, they will be subject to IRS withdrawal penalties to their pre-tax retirement investments. 
 Second, in order to retire comfortably, our research shows a client will need 25 times their income in investments.

 The new functionality calls for a feature that indicates whether the client is old enough to retire without penalties, and has the appropriate income level to live comfortably in retirement.
